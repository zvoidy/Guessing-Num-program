# Guessing Game 

1. In this game, the user is asked to choose a 
number from `1 to n` 

2. The Python program then has to guess what the number is. 

3. The program can ask `“Is it 32?”`

4. The user running the program then must respond with any one of the following three options: 
    - `“higher (H/h)”`  or  
	 - `“lower (L/l)”`   
	 - `"yes"`   
to these questions.

5. The program keeps a count (or tally) of the number of questions that it has asked. 

6. The program continues to provide additional guess until the user's number has been guessed.

## Bonus
7. The challenge in writing the program is to 
guess the answer in the least number of questions possible.
